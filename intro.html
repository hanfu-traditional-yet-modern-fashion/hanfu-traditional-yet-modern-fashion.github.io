                    The Hanfu Movement is a social movement in China led mainly by the younger generations that aims to 
                    normalize the wearing of hanfu, traditional historical Han Chinese clothing, in the modern day. The 
                    clothing popularized in the movement have elements that pull from various dynasties in China’s history 
                    but modern elements are also included to fit today’s fashion trends.<br><br>

                    We will be focusing on four major styles that are popular amongst female participants of the movement—Qiyao 
                    Ruqun (齐腰襦裙), Qixiong Ruqun (齐胸襦裙), Ao Qun (袄裙), and Qu Ju (曲裾). This is, by no means, a 
                    comprehensive list of all the different types of hanfu but they are the four that are illustrated on our site. 
                    Hanfu styles share commonalities such as the use of ties to secure the pieces. For garments that have the 
                    collar folded over each other, the half on the bottom is secured by tying it onto the inside of the top layer 
                    with ribbons and the top is attached to the bottom layer in a similar fashion. Skirts are also usually one 
                    long piece of flat fabric that is wrapped around the body, overlapped, and tied together.<br><br>

                    Within the four major styles, variations are created by changing specific details such as the size of the 
                    sleeves or the shape of the collar. These will be further explained in the information provided on the 
                    individual clothing.<br><br>
                    
                    Along with the clothing, the figure wears some accessories as well. She's holding a fan in her hand that 
                    has an overall circular shape with eight petals. This type of fan is called a Tuan Shan (团扇). They're 
                    usually made from fabric with embroidered details and a wooden framing and handle. Tuan Shan are available 
                    in a variety of different shapes such as circular or other even numbers of petals. Amongst the figure's hair 
                    accessories is a hairpin that is nestled at the top of her wound up hairstyle. This is a Fa Zan (发簪) which 
                    is a long pin that's decorated at one end used to secure a hairstyle in place. They're often created from 
                    metal or carved from wood with elaborate designs. Some, like the figure's Fa Zan, have dangling beads 
                    and jewels as well.
